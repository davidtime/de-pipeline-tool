            <h1>System Builder</h1>
            <p>The system builder gives you a visual representation of how your system will function. It allows you to customize how you want your system to run. We use a drag and drop interface to give a more simplistic appearance for what could be a rather complex system. We mix this with an operator pane that provides more details about the components of a system, allowing you to further customize exactly how you want to run.</p>
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Operator Strip</h2>
            <p>This strip contains all the operators you can use in your system. Simple drag them onto the canvas below to place them in a system. These can be further customized in the <a href="../Operator Library/OperatorLibrary.htm">Operator Library</a>. </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Builder canvas</span>
            </h2>
            <p>The builder canvas is where you can link together your systems and select them to further edit.</p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">A - The system's unique name. It can only contain alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores.</li>
                <li value="2">B- This will save a new system if it hasn't been saved before or overwrite the current system you're working on.</li>
                <li value="3">C - This will always save a new system regardless of if you're working on a new system or one that already exists. It won't overwrite a current system.</li>
                <li value="4">D - This clears and resets the entire canvas. It will clear any reference to whatever system you were working on previously.</li>
                <li value="5">E - The error list. This will become red when there are validation errors. If clicked, it will toggle a console box in the lower right hand corner that explains what your errors are.</li>
                <li value="6">F - The home button. This resets your view to be central among all operators currently in the canvas.</li>
                <li value="7">G - This controls the zoom of your canvas.</li>
                <li value="8">H - This it the output portion of an operator. You can drag this to any input portion of an operator.</li>
                <li value="9">I - This is the input portion of an operator. It accepts any single output from another operator.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Operator Details</h2>
            <p>When an operator is selected, the operator details pane opens up on the right hand side. Here, you can customize the parameters for an operator and even save the finished product it for later use. These operators appear under the STORED&#160;OPERATORS section of the operator strip. A red outline indicates that the property isn't filled out correctly and needs to be changed. A green outline indicates that the property is filled out correctly. You can also hover over the "i" next to a property name to view a description. Note that non-required fields will be green if nothing is filled out. For more information on our property validation, see <a href="BuilderValidation.htm">Builder Validation</a> and <a href="../Operator Library/OperatorValidation.htm">Operator Validation.</a></p>
