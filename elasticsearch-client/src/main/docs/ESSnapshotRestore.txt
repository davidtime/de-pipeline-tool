Use the following commands to backup any or all indices on you ES cluster and restore them on another cluster.  Based on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html.  For the S3 repository option to work you will need to install the elasticsearch-cloud-aws plugin to each of you ES clusters (source and target)

1. On one of the source ES nodes run the following command to register a "repository".  The repository is where you backup is stored.  I named the respository in this case to be "my_s3_repository".  You can name it whatever you like.  I found S3 to be the easiest option for backups as the "fs" option required a shared filesystem that all ES nodes can see.  The "bucket" argument is the bucket where the backup is stored.
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository' -d '
{
    "type": "s3",
    "settings": {
        "bucket": "rtws.es.backup",
        "access_key": "AKIAITMAS3RXDKITGU7Q",
        "secret_key": "JJYdTNjL1ZvqViA0+rBawHSm09PvSqrDLIumkOg3",
        "compress": "true"
    }
}'

2. Create a snapshot (backup) of your indices.  If you leave the indicies argument out, the default is to backup all indicies.
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository/snapshot_1' -d '
{
    "indices": "vehicle_cluster,transportation-index20160303,transportation-index20160302",
    "include_global_state": "false"
}'

3. Check the status of you snapshot process
curl '10.39.66.196:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository/snapshot_1/_status'

4. On one of new ES cluster nodes, register your repository.
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository' -d '
{
    "type": "s3",
    "settings": {
        "bucket": "rtws.es.backup",
        "access_key": "AKIAITMAS3RXDKITGU7Q",
        "secret_key": "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",
        "compress": "true"
    }
}'

5. Run the restore command to copy the backed up indicies to the new target ES cluster.  The "indices" argument can limit the indices that are restored.  The default is all indices in the snapshot.
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository/snapshot_1/_restore' -d '
{
    "indices": "vehicle_cluster,transportation-index20160303,transportation-index20160302"
}'

6. Check the status of your restore process. Note that the restore process will turn the cluster status to Red while it is processing. 
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_cat/recovery?v'
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/<index_name>/_recovery?pretty&human'
